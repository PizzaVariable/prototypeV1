Prince Yamato Take

The insignia of the great Japanese Empire is composed of three treasures which have been considered sacred, and guarded with
jealous care from time immemorial. These are the Yatano-no-Kagami or the Mirror of Yata, the Yasakami-no-Magatama or the Jewel of
Yasakami, and the Murakumo-no-Tsurugi or the Sword of Murakumo.

Of these three treasures of the Empire, the sword of Murakumo, afterwards known as Kusanagi-no—Tsrugugi, or the grass-cleaving
sword, is considered the most precious and most highly to be honored, for it is the symbol of strength to this nation of warriors and
the talisman of invincibility for the Emperor, while he holds it sacred in the shrine of his ancestors.

Nearly two thousand years ago this sword was kept at the shrines of Ite, the temples dedicated to the worship of Amaterasu, the
great and beautiful Sun Goddess from whom the Japanese Emperors are said to be descended.

There is a story of knightly adventure and daring which explains why the name of the sword was changed from that of Murakumo to
Kasanagi, which means grass clearing.

Once, many, many years ago, there was born a son to the Emperor Keiko, the twelfth in descent from the great Jimmu, the founder of
the Japanese dynasty. This Prince was the second son of the Emperor Keiko, and he was named Yamato. From his childhood he
proved himself to be of remarkable strength, wisdom and courage, and his father noticed with pride that he gave promise of great
things, and he loved him even more than he did his elder son.

Now when Prince Yamato had grown to manhood (in the olden days of Japanese history, a boy was considered to have reached man’s
estate at the early age of sixteen) the realm was much troubled by a band of outlaws whose chiefs were two brothers, Kumaso and
Takeru. These rebels seemed to delight in rebelling against the King, in breaking the laws and defying all authority.

At last King Keiko ordered his younger son Prince Yamato to subdue the brigands and, if possible, to rid the land of their evil lives.
Prince Yamato was only sixteen years of age, he had but reached his manhood according to the law, yet though he was such a youth in
years he possessed the dauntless spirit of a warrior of fuller age and knew not what fear was. Even then there was no man who could
rival him for courage and bold deeds, and he received his father’s command with greatjoy.

He at once made ready to start, and great was the stir in the precincts of the Palace as he and his trusty followers gathered together
and prepared for the expedition, and polished up their armor and donned it. Before he left his father’s Court he went to pray at the
shrine of lse and to take leave of his aunt the Princess Yamato, for his heart was somewhat heavy at the thought of the dangers he
had to face, and he felt that he needed the protection of his ancestress, Amaterasu, the Sun Goddess. The Princess his aunt came out
to give him glad welcome, and congratulated him on being trusted with so great a mission by his father the King. She then gave him
one of her gorgeous robes as a keepsake to go with him and to bring him good luck, saying that it would surely be of service to him on
this adventure. She then wished him all success in his undertaking and bade him good speed.

The young Prince bowed low before his aunt, and received her gracious gift with much pleasure and many respectful bows.

“I will now set out,” said the Prince, and returning to the Palace he put himself at the head of his troops. Thus cheered by his aunt’s
blessing, he felt ready for all that might befall, and marching through the land he went down to the Southern Island of Kiushiu, the
home of the brigands.

Before many days had passed he reached the Southern Island, and then slowly but surely made his way to the head-quarters of the
chiefs Kumaso and Takeru. He now met with great difficulties, for he found the country exceedingly wild and rough. The mountains
were high and steep, the valleys dark and deep, and huge trees and bowlders of rock blocked up the road and stopped the progress of
his army. It was all but impossible to go on.

Though the Prince was but a youth he had the wisdom of years, and, seeing that it was vain to try and lead his men further, he said to
himself:

“To attempt to fight a battle in this impassable country unknown to my men only makes my task harder. We cannot clear the roads and
fight as well. It is wiser for me to resort to stratagem and come upon my enemies unawares. In that way I may be able to kill them
without much exertion.”

So he now bade his army halt by the way. His wife, the Princess Ototachibana, had accompanied him, and he bade her bring him the
robe his aunt the priestess of lse had given him, and to help him attire himself as a woman. With her help he put on the robe, and let
his hair down till it flowed over his shoulders. Ototachibana then brought him her comb, which he put in his black tresses, and then
adorned himself with strings of strange jewels just as you see in the picture. When he had finished his unusual toilet, Ototachibana
brought him her mirror. He smiled as he gazed at himself—the disguise was so perfect.

He hardly knew himself, so changed was he. All traces of the warrior had disappeared, and in the shining surface only a beautiful lady
looked back at him.

Thus completely disguised, he set out for the enemy’s camp alone. In the folds of his silk gown, next his strong heart, was hidden a
sharp dagger.

The two chiefs Kumaso and Takeru wore sitting in their tent, resting in the cool of the evening, when the Prince approached. They
were talking of the news which had recently been carried to them, that the King’s son had entered their country with a large army
determined to exterminate their band. They had both heard of the young warrior’s renown, and for the first time in their wicked lives
they felt afraid. In a pause in their talk they happened to look up, and saw through the door of the tent a beautiful woman robed in
sumptuous garments coming towards them. Like an apparition of loveliness she appeared in the soft twilight. Little did they dream
that it was their enemy whose coming they so dreaded who now stood before them in this disguise.

“What a beautiful woman! Where has she come from?” said the astonished Kumaso, forgetting war and council and everything as he
looked at the gentle intruder.

He beckoned to the disguised Prince and bade him sit down and serve them with wine. Yamato Take felt his heart swell with a fierce
glee for he now knew that his plan would succeed. However, he dissembled cleverly, and putting on a sweet air of shyness he
approached the rebel chief with slow steps and eyes glancing like a frightened deer. Charmed to distraction by the girl’s loveliness
Kumaso drank cup after cup of wine for the pleasure of seeing her pour it out for him, till at last he was quite overcome with the
quantity he had drunk.

This was the moment for which the brave Prince had been waiting. Flinging down the wine jar, he seized the tipsy and astonished
Kumaso and quickly killed him with the dagger which he had secretly carried hidden in his breast.

Takeru, the brigand’s brother, was terror-struck as soon as he saw what was happening and tried to escape, but Prince Yamato was
too quick for him. Here he could reach the tent door the Prince was at his heel, his garments were clutched by a hand of iron, and a
dagger flashed before his eyes and he lay stabbed to the earth, dying but not yet dead.

“Wait one moment!” gasped the brigand painfully, and he seized the Prince’s hand.

Yamato relaxed his hold somewhat and said.

”Why should I pause, thou villain?”

The brigand raised himself fearfully and said:

“Tell me from whence you come, and whom I have the honor of addressing? Hitherto I believed that my dead brother and l were the
strongest men in the land, and that there was no one who could overcome us. Alone you have ventured into our stronghold, alone you
have attacked and killed us! Surely you are more than mortal?”

Then the young Prince answered with a proud smile:—”I am the son of the King and my name is Yamato, and l have been sent by my
father as the avenger of evil to bring death to all rebels! No longer shall robbery and murder hold my people in terror!” and he held the
dagger dripping red above the rebel’s head.

“Ah,” gasped the dying man with a great effort, “I have often heard of you. You are indeed a strong man to have so easily overcome us.
Allow me to give you a new name. From henceforth you shall be known as Yamato Take. Our title I bequeath to you as the bravest
man in Yamato.”

And with these noble words, Takeru fell back and died.
